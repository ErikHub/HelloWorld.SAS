Notes used in learning SAS Programming Language  

`Every SAS Statement ends in a semicolon;`  

`* Comments can start with an asterisk and end with a semicolon; or`  
`/* Comments can be commented with a forwardslash and semicolon */ but the first one is better due to some operating systems ending jobs with /*`  
  
`%let path=FILEPATH; `  
`libname orion "&path";`  
You have defined the orion library and SAS knows where you are storing your practice files.  
  
  For SAS University Edition on AWS Marketplace:  
When you stop an instance of SAS University Edition (or if the instance times out), the practice data persists. You must open and submit the setup.sas program to access your practice data in the orion library.  
When you terminate an instance of SAS University Edition, the practice data is deleted along with the instance. You must perform Task 1 and Task 2 when you create a new instance.
